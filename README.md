  This app is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile devices. Its primary purpose is to help massage therapists and businesses manage their clients effectively. The app includes four main tabs:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Active:</strong> Clients currently being seen.</li>
  <li><strong>Waitlist:</strong> Clients waiting to be seen.</li>
  <li><strong>Re-book:</strong> Clients who need to be re-booked for future appointments.</li>
  <li><strong>Archive:</strong> Clients whose profiles are archived.</li>
</ul>
<p>By clicking on a client, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Favorite the client.</li>
  <li>Toggle that there are important notes about the client.</li>
  <li>Change the client's status between the four tabs.</li>
  <li>Keep track of general notes and appointment-specific notes like symptoms, assessment, and plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a client puts them in the waitlist tab.</p>
<p>
  To reset the client list, click the refresh button on the home screen in the top left.
